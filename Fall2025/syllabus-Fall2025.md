### Course Description: 
This course will cover the fundamental topics in data mining including classification, clustering, association analysis, and anomaly detection. The course is aimed towards graduate students who are interested to do research in artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and other related disciplines. This is not an introductory course in data mining. Students who have no experience in data analysis but who are interested to learn more about the tools and programming techniques for big data should enroll in CSE 482 (big data analysis) instead. Homework assignments and the class project require programming in Python. Students are expected to have some basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures, linear algebra, and probability/statistics. If you do not have the mathematical background, you should enrol in CSE 840 (Computational Foundations in AI) first.

There is no textbook for the class. Some of the materials for the class are obtained from the following recommended books: 
- Introduction to Data Mining (2nd Edition) by Tan, Steinbach, Karpatne, and Kumar, Addison Wesley, 2nd Edition (2018)
Sample chapters of the book are available at [here](http://www.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook).

### Course Policies:

- **Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to attend all the lectures and must inform the instructor if they are unable to do so due to emergency or other legitimate reasons. Failure to attend **more than 5 lectures without prior approval** from the instructor will result in 5% deduction from your overall grade.
- **Assignment and Late Submission Policy:** Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date unless specified otherwise. All written portion of your assignments must be typed and submitted in PDF format (no handwritten notes will be accepted). LaTex templates will be provided (Word or other text editors are also acceptable). You must use [D2L](http://d2l.msu.edu) to submit your solution. Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted the next day after the deadline) or 50% (if submitted the second day after the deadline). Assignments submitted later than that will not be accepted.
- **Exam Information:** There will be 1 midterm and 1 final exam. Exams will be open book and notes. The final exam is scheduled to be held on **Wednesday, December 10, 2025 from 10:00am-12:00pm**. Please note the difference between the lecture and final exam date and time. Make-up examination can be arranged if your absence is due to conference travel, documented illness, or personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to the instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. Except for emergency cases, make-up arrangements must be made in advance, at least a week before the scheduled exam. 
- **Discussion Forum:** We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2025/cse881/home) for class discussion. Rather than emailing class-related questions to the instructor, you are encouraged to post them on Piazza. Do not post your partial solution (e.g., snippets of your code) or attempted solution (e.g., for assignments or project) on Piazza. In addition, you are prohibited from posting the course materials (including slides, homework assignments, exam, and their solutions) on any websites without prior permission from the instructor. You are also prohibited from soliciting help by posting homework questions online on websites such as Chegg, Brainly, Quizlet, and other similar websites. Violation of the policy will result in an Academic Dishonesty Report (ADR) filed and a zero grade for the entire assignment. The ADR for students who continue to post questions from assignments to these sites will lead to additional sanctions, including an automatic failing grade of zero (0.0) for the course. 
- **Study Groups:** You are allowed to form study groups to learn the materials in class. However, you are forbidden from sharing the solution of your homework assignments with other students.  This includes sharing your solution for the purpose of double-checking answers. All submitted assignments (homeworks, project, and exam) must be your own work.**Students who were found copying or sharing their solutions with other students will automatically receive a zero for the ENTIRE assignment.* In addition, an Academic Dishonesty Report will be filed and submitted to the university.
- **Generative AI:** Generative AI may be used for brainstorming ideas, outline drafting, and polishing your project report; however, it may not be used to impersonate you, e.g., by writing entire sentences/paragraphs in your project report, providing the entire proof and answers for your homework assignment, or the complete code for your homework assignment and project. If you're unsure about the policy, please contact the instructor.   
- **Resources for Students:** 	Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services, and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD) at 517-884-RCPD or by visiting their website at [http://www.rcpd.msu.edu](http://www.rcpd.msu.edu). Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued an Accommodation Letter. Please present this form to me at the start of the term or at least two weeks prior to the accommodation date (e.g., for exam). MSU CAPS (Counseling and Psychiatric Services) also offers free, confidential support for studentsâ€™ mental health and wellbeing. More information can be found at [https://caps.msu.edu/](https://caps.msu.edu/).

The Department of Computer Science adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life; Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 on the assignment/exam/project.  
- **Religious Observance:** Michigan State University has long had a policy to permit students, faculty/academic staff, and support staff to observe those holidays set aside by their chosen religious faith. If you wish to be absent from class or require an extension for assignment to observe a religious holiday, you must make such an arrangement at least 1 week in advance with the instructor.  
- **Tolerance and Civility:** MSU strives to build an academic community with living and learning environments that expects tolerance of viewpoints and civility toward others, whether at public forums, athletic events, in residential communities, classrooms or laboratories. We call upon all who participate in university events to promote tolerance and civil behavior and to hold themselves to high standards that reflect the universityâ€™s commitment to respect viewpoints that may be different from their own. Only by respecting individuals with diverse perspectives and ideas can we build an environment of civility that is conducive to advancing knowledge and transforming lives.
