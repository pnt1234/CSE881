### Course Description: 
This course will cover the fundamental topics in data mining including classification, clustering, association analysis, and anomaly detection. The course is aimed towards graduate students who are interested to do research in artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and other related disciplines. This is not an introductory course in data mining. Students who have no experience in data analysis but who are interested to learn more about the tools and programming techniques for big data should enroll in CSE 482 (big data analysis) instead. Homework assignments and the class project require programming in Python. Students are expected to have some basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures, linear algebra, and probability/statistics. If you do not have the mathematical background, you should consider enrolling in CSE 840 (Computational Foundations in AI) first.

There is no textbook for the class. Some of the materials for the class are obtained from the following recommended books: 
- Introduction to Data Mining (2nd Edition) by Tan, Steinbach, Karpatne, and Kumar, Addison Wesley, 2nd Edition (2018)
Sample chapters of the book are available at [here](http://www.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook). 
- Mining of Massive Datasets by Leskovec, Rajaraman, and Ullman, 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press (2014), available [here](http://www.mmds.org).

### Course Policies:

- **Attendance:** Students are expected to attend all the lectures and must inform the instructor if they are unable to do so due to emergency or other legitimate reasons. Failure to attend more than 5 lectures without approval from the instructor will result in 5% deduction in your overall grade.
- **Assignment and Late Submission Policy:** Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date unless specified otherwise. All written portion of your assignments must be typed and submitted in PDF format (no handwritten notes will be accepted). LaTex templates will be provided (Word or other text editors are also acceptable). You must use [D2L](http://d2l.msu.edu) to submit your solution. Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted the next day after the deadline) or 50% (if submitted the second day after the deadline). Assignments submitted later than that will not be accepted.
- **Exam Information:** There will be 1 midterm and 1 final exam. Exams will be open book and notes. Make-up examination can be arranged if your absence is due to conference travel, documented illness, or personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to the instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. Except for emergency cases, make-up arrangements must be made in advance, at least a week before the scheduled exam. 
- **Discussion Forum:** We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2023/cse881/home) for class discussion. Rather than emailing class-related questions to the instructor, you are encouraged to post them on Piazza. Do not post your partial solution (e.g., snippets of your code) or attempted solution (e.g., for assignments or project) on Piazza. In addition, you must not post the course materials (including slides, quizzes, homework assignments, exam, and their solutions) on any other websites without permission from the instructor. You are also prohibited from soliciting help by posting quiz and homework questions online on websites such as Chegg, Brainly, Quizlet, and other similar websites. Violation of the policy will result in an Academic Dishonesty Report (ADR) filed and a zero grade for the entire quiz or assignment. The ADR for students who continue to post questions from assignments or quizzes to these sites will lead to additional sanctions, including an automatic failing grade of zero (0.0) for the course. 
- **Study Groups:** You are allowed to form study groups to learn the materials in class. However, you are forbidden from sharing the solution of your quizzes, homework assignments, and programming project with other students.  This includes sharing your solution with another student to double-check answers, which is considered cheating. All submitted assignments (quizzes, homeworks, project, and exam) must be your own work.**Students who were found copying or sharing their solutions with other students will automatically receive a zero for the entire assignment.* In addition, an Academic Dishonesty Report will be filed and submitted to the university.
